before each server run, we need
bundle js
output css
node server.ts

for node cmd we have package.json

build to bundle js
`npm run build`

# to start server

`npm run build && npm start`

# so

we have a server that needs to run
and the frontend to to bundle javascript

npm package.json handle them both
